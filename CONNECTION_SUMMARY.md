### 🔌 API Endpoints Connected

All major endpoints are properly connected:
- Authentication: `/api/users/login`, `/api/users/register`
- Admin: `/api/admin/stats`, `/api/admin/users`
- Restaurants: `/api/restaurants/*`
- Categories: `/api/categories/*`
- Menu Items: `/api/menu-items/*`
- Orders: `/api/orders/*`
- Reviews: `/api/reviews/*`

### 🛠️ Next Steps

1. **Database Setup**: Run the provided SQL schema
2. **Create Admin User**: Use the registration form or insert directly
3. **Create Restaurant Manager**: Register through the restaurant panel
4. **Test Full Workflow**: Create restaurants, menu items, process orders
